        Multimedia is a type of media that uses a variety of information content
        and processing methods (for example, text, audio, graphics, animation,
        video, and interactivity) to inform or entertain the user. The use of
        electronic media to store and experience multimedia content is sometimes
        referred to as multimedia. Multimedia is a type of fine art that is akin
        to traditional mixed media, but with a greater scope. Moreover, "Rich
        media" is a word that refers to interactive multimedia.

        Multimedia can be separated into two types: linear and nonlinear. As in
        a movie presentation, linear active content progresses without the
        viewer having any influence over navigation. Non-linear content, such as
        that found in a computer game or in self-paced computer-based training,
        allows users to control their own development. Hypermedia content is
        another term for non-linear content.

        Multimedia presentations can be viewed live on stage, projected on a
        screen, streamed over the internet, or played locally using a media
        player. A live or recorded multimedia presentation is referred to as a
        broadcast. Analog or digital electronic media technology can be used for
        broadcasts and recordings. It is possible to download or stream digital
        online multimedia. Multimedia streaming might be live or on-demand.

        Multimedia games and simulations can be played with special effects in a
        physical environment, with numerous people in an online network, or
        locally on a computer, gaming system, or simulator.
