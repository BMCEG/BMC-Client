                One of the best comments we received from our clients is that we
                are considered as an extra horsepower for their business and
                that is what keeps us going in expanding our business. We hire
                highly skilled and educated employees, and due to us always
                switching around different companies, our learning curve is
                moving very fast compared to other companies.

                The main reason that companies hire us is to gain full access to
                a specialized skill set that might not exist in house. You get
                access to a group of professionals that have skills and
                capabilities. BMC might not have enough work to keep said
                employees busy all year; we bring them in house when needed.
